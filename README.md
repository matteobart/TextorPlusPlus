## About
**Textor++** is a plain text editor for iOS. It is an updated version of [this](https://github.com/louisdh/textor) open-source project. 
Since it is no longer being updated, I took it upon myself to add new features including:
* Syntax Highlighting for code
* Create any file extenstion
* Tabbing (auto tabbing & button)
* Undo/Redo
* Tabs 2 Spaces
* Spaces 2 Tabs
* Plenty of other coder friendly-features

This version also has general bug fixes & updated syntax (Swift 5)

## Coming Soon
Plenty of helpful text-editing tools such as:
 * Find
 * Find & Replace
 * Line Numbers
 * Ability to change the theme of Syntax Highlighting
 * And plenty more 

For iPad users: 
 * Key bindings
 * Optimized views for iPad
 
 ## Future Future Features
 * Tabs! (multiple files open at once)
 * Auto Completion for coding
 * Get (& Save) documents from OneDrive, Drive, DropBox, etc
 * Be able to open files from external apps (Slack, Notes, etc), edit in Textor++, save to iCloud (or other provider)
 * Support for different worldly languages
 * Use telekinesis to translate thoughts to text
