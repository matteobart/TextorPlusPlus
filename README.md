## About
Textor **++** is a plain text editor for iOS. It is an updated version of [this] (https://github.com/louisdh/textor) open-source project. 
Since it is no longer being updated, I took it upon myself to add new features including:
* Syntax Highlighting for code
* Create any file extenstion
* Tabbing (auto tabbing & button)
* Plenty of other coder friendly-features

This version also has general bug fixes & updated syntax (Swift 5)

## Coming Soon
Plenty of helpful text-editing tools such as:
 * Find
 * Find & Replace
 * Line Numbers
 * Tabs 2 Spaces
 * Spaces 2 Tabs
 * And plenty more 

For iPad users: 
 * Key bindings
 * Optimized views for iPad
